### Monthly Payment Plan Enrollment

Westfield State University offers a monthly payment plan for the fall and spring semesters to help families spread the cost of tuition, fees, and housing over a series of manageable monthly installments. The plan is administered through the Student Financial Services Office and is available to all registered students.

- **Enrollment:** Students can enroll in the payment plan through the university's online student portal. A non-refundable enrollment fee of $50 is required per semester.
- **Eligibility:** All students with a minimum balance of $500 are eligible for the payment plan. Students with past due balances must clear their outstanding debt before they can enroll.

### Payment Deadlines

Adherence to payment deadlines is crucial to avoid late fees and maintain good financial standing with the university.

- **Fall Semester:** Full payment or enrollment in a payment plan is due by **August 15th**.
- **Spring Semester:** Full payment or enrollment in a payment plan is due by **January 15th**.

### Late Payment Penalties

Payments not received by the due date will incur late payment penalties. These penalties are assessed to encourage timely payment and to cover the administrative costs associated with managing delinquent accounts.

A late payment fee of **$100** will be assessed for any payment not received by the specified due date. An additional **1.5%** interest charge will be applied to the outstanding balance for each month the payment is late.

### Accepted Payment Methods

Westfield State University accepts a variety of payment methods to provide convenience and flexibility for our students and their families.

- **Online Payments:** Through the student portal, we accept electronic checks (ACH) and credit/debit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover). A 2.5% convenience fee applies to all credit/debit card transactions.

- **In-Person:** Payments can be made at the Student Financial Services Office during regular business hours.
- **Wire Transfer:** For international payments, please contact the Student Financial Services Office for wire transfer instructions.

### Third-Party Billing

If a third party, such as an employer or a government agency, is paying for a student's tuition, the student must submit a third-party billing authorization form to the Student Financial Services Office. This form must be received by the semester's payment deadline to avoid late fees.
