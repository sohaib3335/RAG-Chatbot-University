## 1. Overview and Purpose

This document outlines the policies and procedures for the Federal Work-Study (FWS) and Westfield State University (WSU) Work-Study programs. These programs provide part-time employment opportunities for eligible students to help meet their educational expenses. The primary purpose of the work-study program is to provide financial assistance through meaningful work experience, which can enhance a student's academic and career goals.

This document covers eligibility requirements, the process for finding and securing a work-study position, guidelines on work hours and payment, and the responsibilities of student employees. All student employees and their supervisors are expected to be familiar with and adhere to these guidelines.

## 2. Eligibility Requirements

To participate in the Federal or University Work-Study program, students must meet the following criteria:

*   **Financial Need:** Students must demonstrate financial need as determined by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). A FAFSA must be filed annually by the priority deadline of March 1st.
*   **Enrollment Status:** Students must be enrolled at least half-time (6 credit hours for undergraduates, 5 credit hours for graduates) in a degree-seeking program at Westfield State University.
*   **Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP):** Students must be meeting the university's SAP standards, which include maintaining a minimum GPA and completing a certain percentage of attempted credits. SAP is reviewed at the end of each academic year.
*   **Work-Study Award:** Students must have a work-study award as part of their financial aid package. Award amounts vary based on financial need and available funding.

Students can check their eligibility and award status through the university's student portal.

## 3. Job Search and Placement

Securing a work-study position is a competitive process and is the responsibility of the student. The Student Financial Services Office maintains an online job board with a list of available on-campus and off-campus positions.

### 3.1. Finding a Position

1.  **Access the Job Board:** Log in to the Westfield State University student portal and navigate to the "Financial Aid" section to find the "Work-Study Job Board."
2.  **Search for Jobs:** Browse available positions. Students can filter by job type, department, or location.
3.  **Apply for Positions:** Follow the application instructions for each position. This typically involves submitting a resume and a brief cover letter. Students may apply for multiple positions.

### 3.2. Hiring Process

1.  **Interviews:** Departments will contact qualified applicants to schedule interviews.
2.  **Job Offers:** If a department wishes to hire a student, they will extend a formal job offer.
3.  **Hiring Paperwork:** Once a student accepts a job offer, they must complete the necessary hiring paperwork with the Student Financial Services Office before their first day of work. This includes the I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification form, W-4 tax withholding form, and a direct deposit authorization.

## 4. Work Hours, Pay, and Timesheets

### 4.1. Work Hours

*   Students may not work more than **20 hours per week** during the academic year (fall and spring semesters).
*   During official university breaks (winter and spring break), students may work up to 40 hours per week, provided their supervisor approves and the hours do not exceed their total work-study award.
*   Students are not permitted to work during their scheduled class times.

### 4.2. Pay Rates

Pay rates for work-study positions are based on the skill level and responsibilities of the job. The current pay rates are as follows:

## 5. Student Employee Responsibilities

As a work-study employee, students are expected to:

*   Perform their job duties to the best of their ability.
*   Adhere to their work schedule and be punctual.
*   Communicate with their supervisor in advance if they are unable to work their scheduled hours.
*   Maintain confidentiality, as many positions involve access to sensitive information.
