## 1. Overview and Purpose

This document outlines the Tuition Refund Policy of Westfield State University, governing the refund of tuition and fees for students who officially withdraw from the university or drop individual courses. The purpose of this policy is to ensure a fair and consistent approach to refunds while complying with federal and state regulations. This policy applies to all undergraduate and graduate students.

Westfield State University is committed to providing clear and accessible information regarding financial matters. This policy details the conditions under which a student may be eligible for a refund, the calculation of refund amounts, and the procedures for requesting and receiving a refund. It is the student's responsibility to understand this policy and the financial implications of withdrawing from the university or dropping courses.


## 2. Tuition and Fees Refund Schedule

The following schedule applies to students who officially withdraw from the university. The refund percentage is applied to the total tuition and mandatory fees assessed for the term.

| Withdrawal Date | Refund Percentage |
| :--- | :--- |
| Before the first day of classes | 100% |
| During the first week of classes | 90% |
| During the second week of classes | 75% |
| During the third week of classes | 50% |
| During the fourth week of classes | 25% |
| After the fourth week of classes | 0% |

**Note:** The academic calendar, which includes the first day of classes and the dates for each week of the semester, is available on the university website.

## 3. Withdrawal from the University

Students who wish to withdraw from the university must complete an official withdrawal form and submit it to the Registrar's Office. The date of withdrawal is the date the form is received by the Registrar's Office. Non-attendance does not constitute an official withdrawal and will result in failing grades and no refund of tuition and fees.

### 3.1. Financial Implications of Withdrawal

When a student withdraws, their financial aid award may be adjusted in accordance with federal and state regulations. Students who receive federal Title IV financial aid are subject to the Return of Title IV Funds calculation, which may result in a portion of their aid being returned to the federal government. This may create a balance due to the university.

## 4. Dropping Individual Courses

Students who drop individual courses but remain enrolled in the university may be eligible for a refund of the tuition for the dropped course(s). The refund is based on the date the course is officially dropped through the university's online registration system.

| Course Drop Date | Refund Percentage |
| :--- | :--- |
| Before the first day of classes | 100% |
| During the first week of classes | 100% |
| During the second week of classes | 50% |
| After the second week of classes | 0% |

## 5. Refund Processing

Refunds are processed after the add/drop period for the semester has ended. The university processes refunds within 30 days of the date the student becomes eligible for the refund.

### 5.1. Credit Balance Refunds

If a student has a credit balance on their account after all charges and financial aid have been applied, a refund will be issued. Students are encouraged to sign up for direct deposit to receive their refund in the most timely manner. If a student does not sign up for direct deposit, a check will be mailed to the student's permanent address on file with the university.

## 6. Return of Title IV Funds

Federal regulations require the university to perform a Return of Title IV Funds calculation for students who withdraw from all classes on or before the 60% point of the semester and who have received federal financial aid. The Title IV funds include: Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), and Federal Direct Loans (Subsidized and Unsubsidized).

The calculation is based on the percentage of the semester the student completed. The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of days the student attended by the total number of days in the semester. If the calculated percentage is 60% or less, a portion of the aid received is considered unearned and must be returned to the respective federal aid programs.

### 6.1. Order of Return of Title IV Funds

Funds are returned to the federal government in the following order:

1.  Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan
2.  Federal Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan
3.  Federal Pell Grant
4.  Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG)

### 6.2. Student Responsibility

If the Return of Title IV Funds calculation results in an amount to be returned that exceeds the amount of the institutional refund, the student will owe a balance to the university. The student is responsible for repaying any funds that were returned to the federal government on their behalf.

## 7. Step-by-Step Refund Procedure

1.  **Complete Official Withdrawal or Course Drop:** Students must officially withdraw from the university or drop courses through the proper channels (Registrar's Office or online registration system).
2.  **Refund Calculation:** The Student Financial Services Office will calculate the refund amount based on the effective date of the withdrawal or drop and the applicable refund schedule.
3.  **Financial Aid Adjustment:** If the student receives financial aid, the Financial Aid Office will review the student's award and make any necessary adjustments, including the Return of Title IV Funds calculation.
4.  **Refund Processing:** Once the refund amount is finalized, the Student Financial Services Office will process the refund.
5.  **Refund Disbursement:** Refunds are disbursed via direct deposit or by check mailed to the student's permanent address.
