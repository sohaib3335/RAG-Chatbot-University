# Westfield State University - Financial Information

**Document Title:** Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid
**Effective Date:** August 1, 2023
**Document Number:** FIN008

## 1. Overview/Purpose

Westfield State University is committed to student success and the responsible stewardship of financial aid funds. In accordance with federal regulations (34 CFR 668.34), the University has established this Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) policy to ensure that students receiving financial aid are making reasonable progress toward the completion of their degree or certificate program. This policy applies to all students who wish to be considered for federal, state, and institutional financial aid programs, including grants, loans, and work-study.

## 2. GPA Requirements

To maintain eligibility for financial aid, students must meet a minimum cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) requirement. The GPA is calculated at the end of each semester (fall, spring, and summer).

| Student Level | Minimum Cumulative GPA |
| --- | --- |
| Undergraduate | 2.00 |
| Graduate | 3.00 |

## 3. Completion Rate Requirements

Students must successfully complete a minimum percentage of the credit hours they attempt. This is known as the "completion rate" or "pace." The completion rate is calculated by dividing the number of successfully completed credit hours by the total number of attempted credit hours.

**Completion Rate Requirement:** All students (both undergraduate and graduate) must maintain a minimum completion rate of 67%.

*   **Attempted Credit Hours:** Include all courses for which a student is registered at the end of the add/drop period, including courses from which the student withdraws.
*   **Completed Credit Hours:** Include all courses for which a student receives a passing grade.

## 4. Maximum Timeframe

Students must complete their degree program within a maximum timeframe, which is set at 150% of the published credit hours required for the program. For example, a bachelor's degree program that requires 120 credit hours must be completed within 180 attempted credit hours.

| Program Type | Required Credit Hours | Maximum Attempted Credit Hours |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bachelor's Degree | 120 | 180 |
| Associate's Degree | 60 | 90 |
| Master's Degree | 36 | 54 |

## 5. SAP Appeal Process

Students who fail to meet the SAP standards will be placed on "Financial Aid Suspension" and will be ineligible for financial aid. However, students with extenuating circumstances may submit a SAP Appeal to have their eligibility reconsidered. Appeals are not guaranteed to be approved.

**Step-by-Step Appeal Procedure:**

1.  **Complete the SAP Appeal Form:** The form is available on the Student Financial Services website.
2.  **Write a Personal Statement:** Explain the extenuating circumstances that led to your failure to meet SAP standards. Provide a detailed account of what has changed that will allow you to be successful in the future.
3.  **Provide Supporting Documentation:** Attach documentation that supports your personal statement, such as a letter from a doctor, a death certificate of a family member, or a police report.
4.  **Submit the Appeal:** Submit the completed appeal form, personal statement, and supporting documentation to the Student Financial Services Office by the deadline.

**Important Deadlines:**

*   **Fall Semester:** October 15th
*   **Spring Semester:** March 15th
*   **Summer Semester:** July 1st

## 6. Academic Plan Requirements

If a SAP appeal is approved, the student will be placed on "Financial Aid Probation" and will be required to follow an academic plan. The academic plan is a contract between the student and the University that outlines the specific academic requirements the student must meet to regain good academic standing. The academic plan may include:

*   A specific GPA to be earned in the upcoming semester.
*   A specific number of credit hours to be completed.
*   Meetings with an academic advisor.
*   Tutoring or other academic support services.

Failure to meet the terms of the academic plan will result in the immediate loss of financial aid eligibility.
