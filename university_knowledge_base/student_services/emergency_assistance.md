## 1. Mission and Purpose

The mission of the Westfield State University Student Emergency Assistance Program is to provide timely and compassionate support to students facing unforeseen financial crises that could otherwise impede their academic success. We are committed to fostering a caring and supportive campus environment by offering immediate, short-term assistance to help students overcome unexpected hardships and continue their educational journey with stability and confidence. This program serves as a critical safety net, ensuring that all students have the opportunity to thrive, regardless of their financial circumstances.

## 2. Services Offered

The Student Emergency Assistance Program provides a range of services designed to address the most pressing needs of students in crisis. Our goal is to offer practical and effective solutions that can make a meaningful difference during a difficult time.

### 2.1. Emergency Grants

Emergency grants are available to students who have experienced a sudden, unexpected financial hardship. These grants are not loans and do not need to be repaid. They are intended to cover essential expenses that, if not met, could cause a student to withdraw from the university.

*   **Covered Expenses:** Emergency grants can be used for a variety of essential needs, including but not limited to:
    *   Rent and utilities
    *   Medical and dental expenses not covered by insurance
    *   Childcare
    *   Transportation costs for emergencies
    *   Replacement of essential personal belongings lost due to fire, theft, or natural disaster
*   **Grant Amounts:** Grant amounts vary based on the student's individual circumstances and demonstrated need. The maximum grant amount is typically $1,000 per academic year.

### 2.2. Food Assistance

We believe that no student should have to choose between buying textbooks and buying groceries. Our food assistance program provides immediate support to students experiencing food insecurity.

*   **Campus Food Pantry:** The program works in close partnership with the Westfield State University Food Pantry, which provides non-perishable food items, fresh produce, and personal hygiene products to students in need. All students with a valid student ID are welcome to visit the pantry once a week.
*   **Meal Vouchers:** In situations where the food pantry cannot meet a student's immediate needs, we may provide meal vouchers that can be used at campus dining halls.

### 2.3. Temporary Housing Support

Students who are experiencing homelessness or are at imminent risk of losing their housing can receive assistance in finding safe, temporary accommodation.

*   **Short-Term Housing:** We partner with local hotels and community organizations to provide short-term emergency housing for up to two weeks.
*   **Housing Consultation:** Our staff can provide guidance and support to students seeking more permanent housing solutions, including information on local housing resources and tenant rights.
