### 1. Mission and Purpose

The Veterans Affairs and Military Student Support office at Westfield State University is dedicated to fostering a supportive and welcoming campus environment for our military-connected students, including veterans, active-duty service members, reservists, National Guard members, and their families. Our mission is to facilitate a smooth transition from military service to academic life, to provide comprehensive support services that enhance educational success, and to empower our students to achieve their personal and professional goals. We are committed to recognizing the unique contributions and experiences of our military-connected students and ensuring they have the resources and support necessary to thrive at Westfield State.

### 2. Services Offered

We offer a wide range of specialized services to meet the unique needs of our military-connected students:

**2.1. GI Bill® Certification**

Our office is the primary point of contact for all GI Bill® and VA education benefit inquiries. We assist students with:

*   **Benefit Counseling:** Understanding your specific VA education benefits, including the Post-9/11 GI Bill®, Montgomery GI Bill®, and others.
*   **Application Assistance:** Guidance on the VA application process to obtain a Certificate of Eligibility (COE).
*   **Certification:** Submitting enrollment certification to the VA each semester to ensure timely payment of benefits. To be certified, students must submit a copy of their COE and a completed Westfield State University "Request for Certification" form to our office each semester.

**2.2. Military Credit Evaluation**

Westfield State University recognizes the value of military training and experience. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of military transcripts for potential academic credit. To have your military experience evaluated, you must submit your official Joint Services Transcript (JST) or Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) transcript to the Office of Admissions. Our academic advisors will review your transcript and award credit based on American Council on Education (ACE) recommendations, where applicable.

**2.3. Priority Registration**

In recognition of their service, veteran and military-connected students are granted priority registration for courses each semester. This allows students to register for classes before the general student population, providing greater flexibility in scheduling and ensuring access to required courses. Eligibility for priority registration is automatically granted to students who have been identified as military-connected through their admissions application or by our office.

*   A quiet study space
*   Information on campus and community resources
*   A kitchenette with complimentary coffee and snacks

**2.5. Transition Support**

We understand that the transition from military to civilian and academic life can be challenging. Our office provides a variety of programs and services to support students through this process:

*   **New Student Orientation:** A specialized orientation program for military-connected students to introduce them to campus resources and services.
*   **Peer Mentoring Program:** The "Vets for Vets" program connects new students with experienced student veterans who can provide guidance, support, and friendship.
*   **Workshops and Seminars:** We host regular workshops on topics such as academic success strategies, career planning, and financial literacy.
