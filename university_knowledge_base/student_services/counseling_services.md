## 1.0 Mission and Purpose

The mission of Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at Westfield State University is to support the holistic well-being of our students. We are committed to providing high-quality, confidential mental health services that foster personal growth, emotional resilience, and academic success. Our purpose is to create a safe, inclusive, and supportive environment where students can explore their concerns, develop coping strategies, and thrive in all aspects of their university experience. We believe that mental health is a vital component of a successful and fulfilling life, and we are dedicated to helping students navigate the challenges and opportunities of their college years.

## 2.0 Services Offered

CAPS provides a comprehensive range of services designed to meet the diverse needs of the Westfield State student community. Our services are delivered by a team of licensed and experienced mental health professionals.

### 2.1 Individual Counseling

Individual counseling offers a private and confidential space for students to discuss a wide array of personal, academic, and social concerns. These one-on-one sessions are tailored to the unique needs of each student and can address issues such as anxiety, depression, stress management, relationship difficulties, identity exploration, and adjustment to university life. Our counselors utilize a variety of therapeutic approaches to help students gain insight, develop new skills, and make positive changes in their lives.

### 2.2 Group Therapy

Group therapy provides an opportunity for students to connect with peers who are facing similar challenges in a supportive and confidential setting. Led by our trained counselors, these groups focus on specific topics, such as anxiety management, social skills, grief and loss, and mindfulness. Participating in a group can help students reduce feelings of isolation, gain different perspectives, and learn from the experiences of others.

### 2.3 Crisis Intervention

For students experiencing a mental health crisis, CAPS offers immediate support and intervention. A crisis may include thoughts of self-harm, overwhelming emotional distress, or the impact of a traumatic event. Our on-call counselors are available to provide urgent assistance, assess for safety, and develop a plan to ensure the student's well-being. After-hours crisis support is also available through our 24/7 hotline.

### 2.4 Psychiatric Services

Our psychiatric services include evaluation and medication management for students who may benefit from psychotropic medication as part of their treatment plan. These services are provided by a board-certified psychiatrist and are integrated with our counseling services to ensure a comprehensive approach to care. An initial assessment will determine if medication is an appropriate option, and follow-up appointments are scheduled to monitor progress and make any necessary adjustments.

## 3.0 Eligibility and Access

All currently enrolled undergraduate and graduate students at Westfield State University are eligible for CAPS services. There is no additional charge for our services, as they are covered by the student health fee.
