The university is committed to a fair and transparent grading system that accurately reflects the academic achievements of its graduate students.

This document provides a comprehensive framework for assigning and recording grades, ensuring consistency across all graduate-level courses and programs. It outlines the expectations for graduate student academic progress and the consequences of failing to meet these standards. All members of the university community are expected to adhere to this policy to maintain academic integrity.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all students enrolled in any graduate-level program at Westfield State University, including master's, doctoral, and certificate programs. It also applies to all faculty members, instructors, and academic administrators involved in graduate education. This policy governs all courses offered for graduate credit, regardless of the mode of delivery (in-person, online, or hybrid).

## 3. Policy

### 3.1. Graduate Grading System

All graduate courses at Westfield State University are graded on a letter-grade basis, unless otherwise specified in the official course catalog. The following grading scale is used to evaluate graduate student performance:

| Grade | Grade Points | Description |
|---|---|---|
| A | 4.00 | Excellent |
| A- | 3.67 | | 
| B+ | 3.33 | | 
| B | 3.00 | Satisfactory |
| B- | 2.67 | | 
| C+ | 2.33 | | 
| C | 2.00 | Passing, but below graduate standards |
| F | 0.00 | Failing |

In addition to the letter grades above, the following administrative notations may appear on a student's transcript:

*   **I (Incomplete):** A temporary notation assigned when a student is unable to complete course requirements due to extenuating circumstances. An Incomplete must be resolved by the deadline specified by the instructor, not to exceed one calendar year. If not resolved, an 'I' will automatically convert to an 'F'.
*   **P (Pass):** A grade assigned for designated non-letter-graded courses, such as certain seminars, internships, or research courses. A 'P' grade is not included in the GPA calculation but counts toward degree credit requirements.
*   **F (Fail):** A grade assigned for designated non-letter-graded courses. An 'F' grade is not included in the GPA calculation but may affect academic standing.
*   **W (Withdrawal):** A notation indicating that a student has officially withdrawn from a course after the add/drop period. A 'W' does not affect the GPA.

### 3.2. Grade Point Average (GPA) Calculation

The GPA is calculated by dividing the total number of grade points earned by the total number of credit hours attempted for letter-graded courses. The formula is as follows:

**GPA = Total Grade Points / Total Credit Hours Attempted**

Courses graded with 'P', 'F', 'I', or 'W' are not included in the GPA calculation. The GPA is calculated at the end of each semester and is also maintained as a cumulative GPA that reflects the student's entire academic history at the graduate level.

### 3.3. Academic Standing

Maintaining satisfactory academic progress is a requirement for all graduate students. Academic standing is determined by the cumulative GPA at the end of each semester.

*   **Good Standing:** A graduate student is in good academic standing if they maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.00 or higher.
*   **Academic Probation:** A student whose cumulative GPA falls below 3.00 will be placed on academic probation. The student will be notified in writing by the Graduate School and will be required to meet with their academic advisor to develop a plan for academic improvement. A student on probation may have restrictions on course loads and other academic activities.
*   **Dismissal:** A student who fails to raise their cumulative GPA to 3.00 after two consecutive semesters on academic probation will be subject to dismissal from their program and the university. A student may also be dismissed for failing to make satisfactory progress in other aspects of their program, as determined by their program faculty.

### 3.4. Transfer Credits

Graduate credits from other accredited institutions may be transferred to a Westfield State University graduate program, subject to the approval of the program director and the Graduate School. A maximum of 30% of the total credit hours required for a degree may be fulfilled through transfer credits. Only courses with a grade of 'B' or better are eligible for transfer. Transferred credits are not included in the GPA calculation.

## 4. Procedures

### 4.1. Grade Appeals

A student who believes a final course grade is incorrect may initiate a grade appeal. The appeal must be based on evidence of a calculation error or a violation of university policy. The appeal process is as follows:

1.  The student must first discuss the grade with the course instructor within 15 business days of the grade being posted.
2.  If the issue is not resolved, the student may submit a formal written appeal to the department chair or program director within 30 business days.
3.  If the matter remains unresolved, the appeal may be escalated to the Dean of the respective college.
4.  The final level of appeal is the Dean of the Graduate School, whose decision is final.
