# Westfield State University Policy

**Policy Title:** AP009: Academic Probation and Dismissal Policy
**Effective Date:** 2022-08-15
**Policy Number:** AP009

## 1.0 Purpose and Overview

Westfield State University is committed to the academic success of its students. This policy outlines the standards for good academic standing, the conditions that lead to academic probation, and the circumstances under which a student may be dismissed from the University. The primary goal of this policy is to identify students who are experiencing academic difficulty and provide them with a structured opportunity to improve their academic performance. It also defines the point at which, after sustained poor academic performance, a student is no longer eligible to continue their studies at the University. This policy is designed to be a supportive measure, encouraging students to utilize university resources to regain good academic standing, while also upholding the academic integrity and standards of Westfield State University.

## 2.0 Scope

This policy applies to all undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in credit-bearing courses at Westfield State University, regardless of their program of study, course load, or campus location. It does not apply to students enrolled in non-credit or professional development programs.

## 3.0 Policy Content

### 3.1 Academic Standing

Academic standing is determined at the end of each regular semester (Fall and Spring) based on the student's cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA).

*   **Good Academic Standing:** Students with a cumulative GPA of 2.00 or higher (for undergraduates) or 3.00 or higher (for graduate students) are considered to be in good academic standing.
*   **Academic Warning:** An undergraduate student whose semester GPA is below 2.00 but whose cumulative GPA is still at or above 2.00 will receive an academic warning.
*   **Academic Probation:** An undergraduate student whose cumulative GPA falls below 2.00, or a graduate student whose cumulative GPA falls below 3.00, will be placed on academic probation.

### 3.2 Conditions of Academic Probation

Students placed on academic probation are required to take specific steps to improve their academic performance. These conditions are mandatory and are designed to provide students with the support and structure needed to succeed.

*   **Academic Recovery Plan:** The student must meet with their academic advisor to develop a formal Academic Recovery Plan within the first three weeks of the semester. This plan will identify specific strategies for academic improvement.
*   **Course Load Limitation:** Students on academic probation may be limited to a maximum of 13 credit hours (for undergraduates) or 9 credit hours (for graduate students) during the probationary semester.
*   **Regular Meetings:** Students must attend regular meetings with their academic advisor or a designated staff member in the Academic Success Center to monitor progress.
*   **Utilization of Resources:** Students are strongly encouraged to utilize university academic support services, such as tutoring, writing centers, and counseling services.

Failure to comply with the conditions of academic probation may result in immediate academic dismissal.

### 3.3 Removal from Academic Probation

A student is removed from academic probation when their cumulative GPA reaches the minimum requirement for good academic standing (2.00 for undergraduates, 3.00 for graduates).

### 3.4 Academic Dismissal

Academic dismissal is the involuntary separation of a student from the University due to poor academic performance. A student will be subject to academic dismissal under the following circumstances:

*   **Undergraduate Students:** An undergraduate student on academic probation who fails to achieve a semester GPA of 2.00 or higher in their probationary semester will be dismissed.
*   **Graduate Students:** A graduate student on academic probation who fails to achieve a semester GPA of 3.00 or higher in their probationary semester will be dismissed.
*   **Sustained Probation:** An undergraduate student who has been on academic probation for two consecutive semesters without returning to good academic standing will be dismissed, regardless of their semester GPA.

Dismissal is reflected on the student's official academic transcript.

## 4.0 Reinstatement Procedures

Students who have been academically dismissed may apply for reinstatement to the University after a separation period of at least one academic year (two regular semesters). Reinstatement is not guaranteed.

### 4.1 Application for Reinstatement

A student seeking reinstatement must submit a formal application to the Office of the Registrar. The application must include:

*   A personal statement explaining the circumstances that led to the dismissal and a detailed plan for achieving academic success if reinstated.
*   Evidence of productive activity during the separation period, such as successful completion of coursework at another accredited institution (with a grade of C or better), or relevant work experience.

### 4.2 Review Process

The Reinstatement Committee, composed of faculty and staff from relevant academic departments and student support offices, will review all applications. The committee will consider the student's past academic record, the quality of their personal statement, and the evidence of their readiness to return to the University.

### 4.3 Conditions of Reinstatement

If reinstatement is granted, the student will be readmitted on academic probation and will be subject to the conditions outlined in Section 3.2 of this policy. Additional conditions may be imposed by the Reinstatement Committee.
