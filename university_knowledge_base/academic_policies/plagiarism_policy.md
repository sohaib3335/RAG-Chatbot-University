## 3.0 Policy

### 3.1 Definition of Plagiarism

Plagiarism is the act of presenting another person's ideas, words, or work as one's own without proper acknowledgment or citation. It is a serious academic offense that undermines the principles of intellectual honesty and the value of a university education. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   **Direct Plagiarism:** Copying text, verbatim, from a source without quotation marks and a proper citation.
*   **Mosaic Plagiarism:** Interweaving one's own words with phrases and sentences from a source without proper citation.
*   **Self-Plagiarism:** Submitting one's own previously submitted work for a new assignment without the prior written permission of the instructor.
*   **Improper Paraphrasing:** Restating someone else's ideas in one's own words without providing a proper citation.
*   **Uncited Sources:** Failing to cite sources for data, images, or other materials used in academic work.
*   **Collusion:** Unauthorized collaboration with another person on an assignment. This includes sharing answers, working together on an individual assignment, or submitting work that is substantially similar to that of another student.

### 3.2 Detection of Plagiarism

Westfield State University is committed to detecting and deterring plagiarism. The university employs a variety of methods to detect plagiarism, including:

*   **Turnitin:** The university subscribes to Turnitin, a plagiarism detection service that compares student work to a vast database of academic and online content. All written assignments may be subject to submission to Turnitin.
*   **Faculty Vigilance:** Faculty members are trained to recognize the signs of plagiarism and are expected to be vigilant in reviewing student work.
*   **Manual Checks:** Faculty may use search engines and other tools to manually check for plagiarism. They may also review a student's previous work to check for inconsistencies in writing style.

### 3.3 Consequences of Plagiarism

The consequences for plagiarism are serious and are intended to be educational and restorative, as well as punitive. Sanctions are determined based on the severity of the offense, the student's intent, and the student's prior record of academic dishonesty. The following are the general categories of sanctions:

*   **Minor Offenses:** These typically involve unintentional or first-time offenses, such as improper citation or a small amount of unattributed text. Sanctions may include a requirement to revise and resubmit the assignment, a grade reduction on the assignment, or a grade of zero on the assignment.
*   **Moderate Offenses:** These include more substantial instances of plagiarism, such as submitting a paper with significant portions of unattributed text or a second offense of a minor nature. Sanctions may include a failing grade in the course, a formal written warning, and a requirement to complete an academic integrity workshop.
*   **Major Offenses:** These are the most serious cases of plagiarism, such as submitting a purchased paper, a third offense, or a case involving a thesis or dissertation. Sanctions may include suspension or expulsion from the university, and a permanent notation on the student's academic record.

In addition to the above penalties, students who are found to have plagiarized may also be subject to other disciplinary actions, including but not limited to, loss of scholarships, removal from leadership positions, and a permanent notation on their transcript.

### 3.4 Appeal Process

Students who are accused of plagiarism have the right to appeal the decision. The appeal process is as follows:

1.  The student must submit a written appeal to the instructor within ten (10) business days of being notified of the alleged plagiarism.
2.  The instructor will review the appeal and provide a written response to the student within five (5) business days.
3.  If the student is not satisfied with the instructor's decision, they may appeal to the department chair.
4.  If the student is not satisfied with the department chair's decision, they may appeal to the Dean of the college.
5.  The student may appeal the department chair's decision to the Academic Appeals Committee, which is composed of faculty and students. The Committee will review all materials and provide a final, binding decision.

## 4.0 Procedures

Faculty members who suspect a student of plagiarism must follow these procedures:

1.  Meet with the student to discuss the alleged plagiarism.
