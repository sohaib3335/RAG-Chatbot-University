## 3.0 Policy Content

### 3.1 Definitions of Academic Dishonesty

Academic dishonesty is any action or attempted action that may result in creating an unfair academic advantage for oneself or an unfair academic advantage or disadvantage for any other member of the academic community. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:

*   **Cheating:** Any attempt to give or obtain assistance in a formal academic exercise without due acknowledgment. Examples include, but are not limited to: copying from another student's work; using unauthorized materials, information, or study aids in any academic exercise; possessing or using electronic devices during an exam without explicit permission; and receiving unauthorized assistance on a take-home assignment.

*   **Plagiarism:** The representation of another person's words, ideas, or work as one's own without proper attribution. This can be intentional or unintentional. Examples include, but are not limited to: submitting a paper written by another person; copying and pasting text from any source without using quotation marks and providing a citation; paraphrasing another person's work too closely to the original; and submitting a paper that has been purchased or otherwise obtained from a commercial source.

*   **Fabrication:** The falsification, invention, or misrepresentation of any information, data, or citation in an academic exercise. Examples include, but are not limited to: inventing data for a research project; citing sources that were not actually consulted; and misrepresenting the nature or extent of one's research.

*   **Collusion:** Unauthorized collaboration with another person in preparing academic work offered for credit. This is distinct from collaborative learning, which is encouraged. Examples of collusion include, but are not limited to: working with another student on an assignment that was intended to be completed individually; and sharing answers to a take-home exam or quiz.

*   **Academic Misconduct:** Any other act that violates the principles of academic integrity. Examples include, but are not limited to: altering academic records or transcripts; submitting the same work for credit in multiple courses without the explicit permission of all instructors involved; and knowingly facilitating academic dishonesty by another student.
