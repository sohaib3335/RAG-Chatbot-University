# Westfield State University Policy

**Policy Title:** Incomplete Grade Policy
**Policy Number:** AP011
**Effective Date:** June 1, 2023

---

## 1.0 Purpose and Overview

Westfield State University ("the University") is committed to supporting students who experience unforeseen, serious, and extenuating circumstances that prevent them from completing their coursework by the end of a semester. This policy establishes the conditions and procedures for granting an "Incomplete" (I) grade, providing a structured pathway for students to fulfill their academic requirements.

The primary purpose of this policy is to ensure fairness and consistency in the application of incomplete grades across all academic departments. It outlines the eligibility criteria for students, the responsibilities of both students and instructors, and the process for resolving an incomplete grade within a specified timeframe. This policy is designed to be a temporary and exceptional measure, not a substitute for diligent and timely completion of coursework.

## 2.0 Scope

This policy applies to all undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in credit-bearing courses at Westfield State University. It also applies to all faculty, instructors, academic advisors, and administrative staff involved in the grade reporting and academic records process.

## 3.0 Policy Content

### 3.1 Eligibility for an Incomplete Grade

A student may be considered for an Incomplete grade only if all the following conditions are met:

*   The student has completed a substantial portion (at least 75%) of the coursework for the semester.
*   The student is in good academic standing in the course, with a passing grade at the time of the request.
*   The student is unable to complete the remaining coursework due to a documented, serious, and unforeseen circumstance beyond their control. Such circumstances may include, but are not limited to:
    *   A severe medical condition or emergency affecting the student or a close family member.
    *   A family emergency or death.
    *   A legal obligation or military deployment.
    *   Other catastrophic events as approved by the Dean of Students.

### 3.2 Non-Eligible Circumstances

An Incomplete grade will not be granted for reasons such as:

*   Poor academic performance or failure to keep up with coursework throughout the semester.
*   The need to improve a grade.
*   Pre-planned events, travel, or employment, unless related to a university-sanctioned activity.
*   Failure to attend class or submit assignments without a valid, documented reason.

### 3.3 Incomplete Grade Contract

If an instructor agrees to grant an Incomplete grade, the instructor and student must complete and sign an "Incomplete Grade Contract." This contract serves as a formal agreement outlining the remaining work to be completed and the deadline for submission. The contract must include:

*   A detailed list of all outstanding assignments, examinations, or other coursework.
*   The agreed-upon deadline for completion, which may not exceed the last day of classes of the following full semester (fall or spring).
*   The default grade that will be assigned if the work is not completed by the deadline. This grade will be calculated based on the work completed to date and a zero for all outstanding assignments.

A copy of the signed contract must be submitted to the department chair and the Office of the University Registrar.

### 3.4 Completion Deadline

The standard deadline for the completion of an Incomplete grade is the last day of classes of the subsequent fall or spring semester. For example, an Incomplete grade from a fall semester must be completed by the end of the following spring semester. An Incomplete grade from a spring or summer semester must be completed by the end of the following fall semester.

### 3.5 Grade Conversion

Upon completion of the required coursework, the instructor will submit a "Change of Grade" form to the Office of the University Registrar. The "I" grade will then be converted to the final letter grade earned by the student.

If the student fails to complete the coursework by the established deadline, the "I" grade will automatically convert to the default grade specified in the Incomplete Grade Contract, or an "F" if no default grade was specified.

### 3.6 Extension of Deadline

In rare and exceptional cases, a student may petition for an extension of the completion deadline. A request for an extension must be submitted in writing to the instructor and the department chair before the original deadline expires. The request must include documentation of the extenuating circumstances that prevent the student from meeting the deadline. Extensions are not guaranteed and will be considered on a case-by-case basis by the academic dean of the student's college.
