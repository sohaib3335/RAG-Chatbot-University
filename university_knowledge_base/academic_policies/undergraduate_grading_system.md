## 2.0 Scope

This policy does not cover graduate-level courses, which are governed by the Graduate Grading System Policy (AP002).

## 3.0 Policy

### 3.1 Grading System

Westfield State University uses a letter grading system to evaluate student performance. The following letter grades are used, with their corresponding grade points per credit hour:

| Letter Grade | Grade Points | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A | 4.00 | **Excellent:** Indicates outstanding achievement and a thorough mastery of the course material. |
| A- | 3.70 | |
| B+ | 3.30 | |
| B | 3.00 | **Good:** Indicates a high level of achievement and a solid understanding of the course material. |
| B- | 2.70 | |
| C+ | 2.30 | |
| C | 2.00 | **Satisfactory:** Indicates a basic understanding of the course material and fulfillment of course requirements. |
| C- | 1.70 | |
| D+ | 1.30 | |
| D | 1.00 | **Poor:** Indicates a minimal understanding of the course material and a need for significant improvement. |
| F | 0.00 | **Failing:** Indicates that the student has not met the minimum requirements of the course. |

### 3.2 Grade Point Average (GPA) Calculation

The GPA is a measure of a student's average academic performance. It is calculated by dividing the total number of grade points earned by the total number of credit hours attempted for which grade points are awarded. The formula for GPA calculation is as follows:

**GPA = Total Grade Points / Total Credit Hours Attempted**

- **Total Grade Points:** The sum of the products of the grade points and the credit hours for each course.
- **Total Credit Hours Attempted:** The sum of the credit hours for all courses in which a student has received a letter grade of A, B, C, D, or F.

Courses for which a student receives a grade of P (Pass), F (Fail), I (Incomplete), or W (Withdrawal) are not included in the GPA calculation.

### 3.3 Dean's List

Full-time undergraduate students who demonstrate exceptional academic performance in a semester are eligible for the Dean's List. To be eligible, a student must:

- Be enrolled in at least 12 credit hours for the semester.
- Achieve a semester GPA of 3.50 or higher.
- Have no grade lower than a C in any course for the semester.
- Have no incomplete grades for the semester.

The Dean's List is compiled at the end of each fall and spring semester.

### 3.4 Latin Honors

Westfield State University recognizes sustained academic excellence by awarding Latin honors to graduating undergraduate students. To be eligible for Latin honors, a student must have completed at least 60 credit hours at Westfield State University. The levels of honors are based on the cumulative GPA and are as follows:

- **Summa Cum Laude:** Awarded to students with a cumulative GPA of 3.90 or higher.
- **Magna Cum Laude:** Awarded to students with a cumulative GPA of 3.70 to 3.89.
- **Cum Laude:** Awarded to students with a cumulative GPA of 3.50 to 3.69.

### 3.5 Incomplete Grades

An Incomplete (I) grade may be granted at the discretion of the instructor when a student is unable to complete a small portion of the course requirements due to circumstances beyond their control. The student must have a passing grade in the course at the time the Incomplete is requested. The student must complete the remaining coursework by the deadline specified by the instructor, which may not exceed one semester. If the work is not completed by the deadline, the Incomplete grade will be converted to an F.

### 3.6 Pass/Fail Option

Students may elect to take a limited number of courses on a Pass/Fail (P/F) basis. A grade of P is awarded for work that is C- or better. A grade of F is awarded for work that is D+ or lower. A grade of P does not affect the GPA, but a grade of F is calculated into the GPA. Students should consult with their academic advisor before electing the Pass/Fail option, as some courses may not be taken on a P/F basis and some programs may have restrictions on the number of P/F courses allowed.

## 4.0 Procedures

### 4.1 Grade Reporting

Faculty are required to submit final grades for all students by the deadline specified in the academic calendar for each semester. Grades are submitted through the university's official online portal. Students may view their grades online through the student information system.

### 4.2 Grade Changes

A final grade, once submitted, is considered permanent. A grade may be changed only in the case of a clerical or computational error. A request for a grade change must be initiated by the instructor and approved by the department chair and the dean of the college. All grade changes must be submitted within one semester of the original grade submission.

### 4.3 Grade Appeals

Students who believe that a final grade is incorrect due to a clerical error or that the grading was arbitrary or capricious may appeal the grade. The appeal process is as follows:

1. The student must first discuss the grade with the instructor.
2. If the matter is not resolved, the student may submit a written appeal to the department chair.
3. If the matter is still not resolved, the student may submit a written appeal to the dean of the college.
4. The decision of the dean is final.
