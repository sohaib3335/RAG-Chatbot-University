# AP007: Final Examination Procedures

## 1.0 Purpose and Overview

Westfield State University is committed to academic integrity and the fair and equitable assessment of student learning. This policy establishes the procedures and regulations governing final examinations to ensure a consistent and structured approach across all academic departments. It provides a framework for the scheduling, administration, and conduct of final examinations, addressing potential conflicts, accommodations for students with disabilities, and procedures for makeup examinations. The primary objective is to uphold the academic standards of the University while providing clear and transparent guidelines for both faculty and students.

This policy is designed to minimize scheduling conflicts, ensure the security of examination materials, and create an environment conducive to fair and accurate assessment. By standardizing these procedures, the University aims to reduce ambiguity and ensure that all students are treated fairly and consistently. All members of the university community are expected to adhere to this policy to maintain the integrity of the academic assessment process.

## 2.0 Scope

This policy applies to all undergraduate and graduate students, faculty members, and academic staff involved in the administration of final examinations for all courses at Westfield State University. This includes all modalities of instruction, whether in-person, hybrid, or fully online. Specific colleges or departments may have supplementary guidelines that must be consistent with this university-wide policy.

## 3.0 Policy Content

### 3.1 Scheduling of Final Examinations

Final examinations are held at the end of each academic semester during the officially designated final examination period. The Registrar's Office is responsible for publishing the final examination schedule no later than the fourth week of the semester. The schedule will be made available on the university's official website and through the student information system.

Examinations are scheduled in two-hour blocks. No final examination shall be scheduled on a Sunday or a university-recognized holiday. Any deviation from the published schedule must be approved in writing by the Dean of the respective college at least four weeks prior to the start of the final examination period.

### 3.2 Student Responsibilities

Students are responsible for being aware of the final examination schedule and for arriving at the designated location on time. Students must bring their university-issued identification card to all examinations. All personal belongings, including bags, coats, and electronic devices (unless explicitly permitted), must be stored in a designated area and not be accessible during the examination.

### 3.3 Faculty Responsibilities

Faculty members are responsible for preparing and administering final examinations in accordance with this policy. They must ensure that examinations are secure and that all students have a fair opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge. Faculty must be present for the duration of the examination or designate a qualified proctor. Examination materials, including completed exams, must be handled securely and confidentially.

### 3.4 Examination Conflicts

An examination conflict is defined as two or more examinations scheduled at the same time, or three or more examinations scheduled on the same calendar day. Students with a documented examination conflict must submit a Final Examination Conflict Resolution Form to the Registrar's Office no later than three weeks prior to the first day of the final examination period.

The Registrar's Office will work with the relevant faculty members to resolve the conflict. In general, the faculty member of the course with the lower enrollment will be responsible for providing an alternate examination time. This alternate time must be mutually agreeable to the student and the faculty member.

### 3.5 Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

Westfield State University is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for students with documented disabilities. Students requiring accommodations for final examinations must be registered with the Office of Disability Services (ODS). The ODS will work with the student and the faculty member to ensure that appropriate accommodations are provided. All requests for accommodations must be submitted to the ODS at least four weeks prior to the start of the final examination period to ensure timely arrangements.

### 3.6 Makeup Examinations

A student who is unable to take a final examination at the scheduled time due to a documented medical emergency, a death in the immediate family, or other serious unforeseen event may request a makeup examination. The student must notify the instructor and the Dean of Students Office as soon as possible. Documentation verifying the reason for the absence is required.

The instructor, in consultation with the Dean of Students, will determine whether a makeup examination is warranted. If approved, the makeup examination will be scheduled at a mutually agreeable time, but no later than the end of the second week of the following semester.

### 3.7 Conduct During Examinations

All students are expected to adhere to the University's Code of Academic Integrity during final examinations. Any form of academic dishonesty, including but not limited to cheating, plagiarism, or unauthorized collaboration, will not be tolerated. Proctors are authorized to take immediate action to stop any suspected academic misconduct, which may include confiscating examination materials and dismissing the student from the examination room.

Any suspected violation of the Code of Academic Integrity will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct for investigation and potential disciplinary action. Sanctions for academic dishonesty can range from a failing grade on the examination to suspension or expulsion from the University.
