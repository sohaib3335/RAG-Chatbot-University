## Course Registration Procedures

### 1.0 Purpose and Overview

This document outlines the official procedures for course registration at Westfield State University. The purpose is to provide a clear and comprehensive guide for all students to successfully register for courses each academic term. These procedures are designed to ensure a fair and equitable registration process, manage course enrollments effectively, and provide students with the necessary information to navigate the registration system. The university’s online registration system, "WestfieldConnect," is the primary platform for all registration activities.

### 2.0 Scope

These procedures apply to all undergraduate and graduate students at Westfield State University who are eligible to enroll in courses. This includes full-time, part-time, and non-degree-seeking students. All faculty and staff involved in the registration process, including academic advisors, departmental administrators, and the Registrar's Office, are also expected to adhere to these procedures.

### 3.0 Procedures

#### 3.1 Registration Periods

Registration for each academic term is divided into specific periods. Students are responsible for being aware of and adhering to the registration dates and deadlines published in the official Academic Calendar.

*   **Priority Registration:** This period is for continuing students and is based on the total number of credits earned. Students with more credits are given earlier registration appointments to reward their academic progress. The schedule for priority registration is published on the Registrar's Office website at the beginning of each term.
*   **Open Registration:** Following the priority registration period, open registration allows all eligible students to register for courses. During this time, students can add or drop courses as needed.
*   **Late Registration:** A late registration period is available for students who miss their scheduled registration appointments. A late registration fee may be assessed.

#### 3.2 Priority Registration

Priority registration appointments are assigned based on a student's earned credit hours. Students can view their assigned registration time in WestfieldConnect. It is the student's responsibility to check their registration appointment and be prepared to register at their designated time. Students are encouraged to meet with their academic advisor prior to their registration appointment to discuss course selection.

#### 3.3 Waitlists

If a course is full, students may have the option to add themselves to a waitlist. The waitlist is an electronic list of students who are waiting for a seat to become available in a closed course. If a registered student drops the course, the first student on the waitlist will be automatically enrolled. Students on the waitlist are not guaranteed a seat in the course. It is the student's responsibility to monitor their position on the waitlist and their course schedule.

#### 3.4 Registration Holds

A registration hold prevents a student from registering for courses. Holds may be placed on a student's account for various reasons, including:

*   **Financial Holds:** Outstanding tuition or fees.
*   **Advising Holds:** Required advising appointments that have not been completed.
*   **Judicial Holds:** Unresolved disciplinary issues.
*   **Health Services Holds:** Missing immunization records.

Students can view any holds on their account in WestfieldConnect. The hold must be resolved with the originating office before the student can register for courses.

#### 3.5 Course Capacity Limits

Each course has a maximum enrollment capacity, which is determined by the academic department. These limits are in place to ensure a quality learning environment and are based on factors such as classroom size, instructional resources, and pedagogical considerations. The university does not guarantee the availability of courses. Students are encouraged to have alternative course selections in mind in case their first-choice courses are full.

### 4.0 Deadlines and Timelines

All important dates and deadlines related to registration are published in the Academic Calendar on the university website. Key deadlines include:

*   **Registration Start and End Dates:** The first and last day to register for courses.
*   **Add/Drop Deadline:** The last day to add or drop a course without academic or financial penalty.
*   **Withdrawal Deadline:** The last day to withdraw from a course with a "W" grade.

### 5.0 Required Forms and Systems

*   **WestfieldConnect:** The university's online portal for all registration activities, including viewing registration appointments, adding and dropping courses, and checking for holds.
*   **Course Request Form:** For courses that require instructor or departmental permission to enroll, students must submit a signed Course Request Form to the Registrar's Office.
