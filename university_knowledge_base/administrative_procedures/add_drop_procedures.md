### 1.0 Purpose and Overview

This document outlines the official procedures and associated deadlines for undergraduate and graduate students to add or drop courses at Westfield State University for standard 15-week semesters. The add/drop period provides students with a necessary window to adjust their academic schedules. It is the student's responsibility to be aware of these policies and to ensure their course schedule is accurate by the stated deadlines. Failure to follow these procedures may result in academic and financial penalties. All schedule adjustments must be completed through the university's official student information system, **WestfieldConnect**.

### 2.0 Scope

These procedures apply to all undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in credit-bearing courses at Westfield State University. Specific professional schools or specialized programs may have additional or different procedures; students in such programs should consult their respective school or program office for guidance. This policy does not cover complete withdrawal from the university.

### 3.0 Procedures

#### 3.1 Course Add Period

The **Course Add Period** is the designated time when students can add courses to their schedule. This period typically runs from the start of registration through the first seven (7) calendar days of the semester.

**Step-by-Step Instructions for Adding a Course:**
1.  Log in to the **WestfieldConnect** portal using your university credentials.
2.  Navigate to the "Academics" tab and select "Register for Classes."
3.  Select the appropriate academic term.
4.  Use the "Find Classes" feature to search for open courses. You can search by subject, course number, instructor, or keyword.
5.  Once you have identified a course you wish to add, click the "Add" button. The course will be moved to your "Summary" panel with a "Pending" status.
6.  Click the "Submit" button in the bottom right corner to finalize the registration. If successful, the course status will change to "Registered."

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Prerequisites:** The system will automatically check for prerequisites. If you have not met them, you will not be able to register without a prerequisite override from the department offering the course.
*   **Closed Courses:** Students may not add a course that has reached its maximum enrollment capacity. Some departments may offer a waitlist option. If a spot becomes available, the first student on the waitlist will be notified via their university email and will have 24 hours to register.
*   **Advisor Approval:** Undergraduate students may be required to consult with their academic advisor before making schedule changes. A registration hold may be in place until this consultation is complete.

#### 3.2 Course Drop Period

The **Course Drop Period** allows students to drop courses without academic penalty. The implications of dropping a course vary depending on when the action is taken.

**A. Dropping a Course During the Add/Drop Period (First 7 Calendar Days):**
*   Courses dropped during this time will be removed from the student's academic transcript and will not appear on their permanent record.
*   A 100% tuition and fee adjustment for the dropped course will be applied to the student's account.

**Step-by-Step Instructions for Dropping a Course:**
1.  Log in to the **WestfieldConnect** portal.
2.  Navigate to the "Register for Classes" section under the "Academics" tab.
3.  In the "Summary" panel, locate the course you wish to drop.
4.  From the "Action" dropdown menu next to the course, select "Web Drop."
5.  Click the "Submit" button to finalize the action. The course will be removed from your schedule.

**B. Dropping a Course After the Add/Drop Period (Day 8 through the "W" Grade Deadline):**
*   The deadline to drop a course with a grade of "W" (Withdrawn) is typically the end of the 10th week of the semester. Please refer to the official Academic Calendar for the specific date.
*   A grade of "W" will be recorded on the student's official transcript. This grade does not impact the student's GPA.
*   There is **no tuition adjustment** for courses dropped after the initial add/drop period.
*   Dropping a course may impact financial aid eligibility, athletic eligibility, and visa status for international students. Students are strongly encouraged to consult with the Financial Aid Office and their academic advisor before dropping a course after the add/drop period.

**Step-by-Step Instructions for Withdrawing from a Course:**
1.  Obtain a "Course Withdrawal Form" from the Registrar's Office website or in person.
2.  Complete the student information section of the form.
3.  Obtain the signature of your academic advisor. The advisor's signature confirms that you have discussed the academic implications of the withdrawal.
4.  Submit the completed and signed form to the Office of the University Registrar before the deadline.

### 7.0 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: What is the difference between dropping a course and withdrawing from a course?**
A1: Dropping a course occurs within the first week of the semester and removes the course from your transcript entirely with a full tuition refund. Withdrawing from a course occurs after the first week and results in a "W" grade on your transcript, with no tuition adjustment.

**Q2: I missed the deadline to add a course. Can I still get in?**
A2: Late registration is generally not permitted. In rare and extenuating circumstances, a student may petition the department offering the course, but approval is not guaranteed.

**Q3: Will a "W" grade affect my GPA?**
A3: No, a "W" grade is not calculated into your Grade Point Average. However, a pattern of "W" grades may be a cause for concern for graduate schools or future employers.

**Q4: How do I get a prerequisite override?**
A4: You must contact the academic department that offers the course. If the department chair or a designated faculty member grants permission, they will process the override in the system, allowing you to register.
