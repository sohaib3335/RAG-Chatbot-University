## Change of Major or Minor Request

### 1. Purpose/Overview

This document outlines the official procedure for undergraduate students at Westfield State University to request a change of their academic major or minor. The university recognizes that students' academic interests and career goals may evolve. This procedure is designed to provide a clear and structured pathway for students to transition to a new program of study while ensuring they receive appropriate academic advising and support. The process is intended to be fair, transparent, and consistent across all academic departments.

### 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all currently enrolled undergraduate students at Westfield State University who wish to:

*   Change their primary major.
*   Declare a second major.
*   Add or drop a minor.

This policy does not apply to graduate students, who should consult the Graduate School for relevant procedures.

### 3. Procedures

Changing a major or minor is a significant academic decision that requires careful consideration and planning. Students are expected to follow the steps below to ensure a smooth transition.

**Step 1: Initial Research and Exploration**

Before initiating a formal request, students are strongly encouraged to research their intended major or minor. This includes reviewing the program curriculum, course requirements, and potential career paths. The University Catalog and the websites of the academic departments are the primary resources for this information. Students should also consider attending information sessions or workshops hosted by the department of their intended major.

**Step 2: Meeting with an Academic Advisor**

Students are required to meet with an academic advisor to discuss their interest in changing their major or minor. This meeting serves several purposes:

*   To ensure the student understands the requirements of the new program.
*   To discuss the potential impact on the student's graduation timeline.
*   To review the student's academic record and determine their eligibility for the new program.
*   To develop an academic plan for the new major or minor.

Students should schedule an appointment with an advisor in the Academic Advising Center.

**Step 3: Submitting the Change of Major/Minor Request Form**

After meeting with an academic advisor, students must complete and submit the official Change of Major/Minor Request Form. This form is available on the Registrar's Office website and must be submitted electronically through the university's student portal.

The form requires the following information:

*   Student's name and ID number.
*   Current major and minor (if any).
*   Intended major and minor.
*   A brief statement explaining the reason for the change.
*   Signature of the student and the academic advisor.

**Step 4: Departmental Review**

Once the form is submitted, it will be routed to the department of the intended major for review. The department will assess the student's eligibility based on their academic record, including GPA and completed coursework. Some departments may have additional requirements, such as a minimum GPA or the completion of specific prerequisite courses.

**Step 5: Notification of Decision**

The department will notify the student of their decision in writing within 15 business days of receiving the request. The notification will be sent to the student's official university email address. If the request is approved, the student's academic record will be updated to reflect the new major or minor. If the request is denied, the notification will include the reason for the denial and information about the appeal process.

### 4. Deadlines and Timelines
