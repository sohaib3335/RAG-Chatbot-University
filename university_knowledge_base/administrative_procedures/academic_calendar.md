## 6.0 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: Where can I find the most up-to-date academic calendar?**
A1: The official and most current academic calendar is always available on the Office of the Registrar's section of the Westfield State University website.

**Q2: What is the difference between dropping a course and withdrawing from a course?**
A2: Dropping a course can be done during the add/drop period at the beginning of the semester and the course will not appear on your academic transcript. Withdrawing from a course occurs after the add/drop period, and a grade of "W" will be recorded on your transcript. A "W" does not affect your GPA.

**Q3: What happens if I miss my registration date?**
A3: You can still register for courses after your assigned registration date, but course availability may be limited. It is highly recommended to register on your assigned date for the best selection of courses.

### 3.5 Summer and Winter Sessions

Westfield State University offers condensed academic sessions during the summer and winter breaks. These sessions provide students with opportunities to catch up on credits, get ahead in their studies, or take specialized courses.

*   **Summer Session:** Typically runs from late May to mid-August and is divided into two or more shorter sessions. Course offerings are announced in the spring semester.
*   **Winter Session:** A short, intensive session offered in January between the fall and spring semesters. Course offerings are announced in the fall semester.

Registration for these sessions is separate from fall and spring registration and has its own set of deadlines, which are published on the Registrar's website.

### 3.6 Grade Submission and Academic Standing

Faculty are required to submit final grades through WestfieldConnect by the deadline specified in the academic calendar. Once grades are submitted, they are processed by the Office of the Registrar and become available to students.

At the end of each semester, student academic records are reviewed to determine academic standing. Students must maintain a minimum GPA to remain in good academic standing, as outlined in the University's academic policies.

**Q4: How do I register for summer or winter classes?**
A4: Registration for summer and winter sessions is done through WestfieldConnect. The schedule of classes and registration dates are announced on the university website and by the Office of the Registrar.

**Q5: What if a class I need is already full?**
A5: Many departments maintain waitlists for high-demand courses. You should add yourself to the waitlist through WestfieldConnect. If a spot becomes available, you will be notified via your university email. It is also a good idea to contact the department offering the course for advice.

**Q6: How does the university handle inclement weather?**
A6: In the event of severe weather, the university may cancel classes or close entirely. Announcements will be made through the university's emergency notification system, on the university's homepage, and via local media outlets. Unless an official announcement is made, you should assume that classes will be held as scheduled.
