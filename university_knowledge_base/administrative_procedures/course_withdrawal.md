> **Procedure ADM005: Course Withdrawal Policy**
> **Effective Date:** August 15, 2023

## 1. Purpose and Overview

This document outlines the official procedure for students to withdraw from a course at Westfield State University after the add/drop period has ended. The policy is designed to provide a clear and consistent process for withdrawal, detailing the academic and financial implications. This procedure ensures that students have a comprehensive understanding of the consequences of withdrawing from a course, including the assignment of a "W" (Withdrawal) grade, and the potential impact on financial aid and academic standing.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in credit-bearing courses at Westfield State University who wish to withdraw from one or more courses after the official add/drop period for a given semester. It does not apply to withdrawals from the university (i.e., withdrawing from all courses), which is covered under a separate policy.

## 3. Procedure

### 3.1. Standard Course Withdrawal

Students may withdraw from a course and receive a "W" grade on their academic transcript by following these steps:

1.  **Consult with Academic Advisor:** Before initiating a withdrawal, students are strongly encouraged to meet with their academic advisor to discuss the potential consequences of withdrawing from the course. The advisor can provide guidance on academic progress, time to graduation, and alternative options.

2.  **Obtain Course Withdrawal Form:** The official Course Withdrawal Form can be obtained from the Registrar's Office website or in person at the Registrar's Office (Student Services Building, Room 210).

3.  **Complete the Form:** The student must complete the form, including their name, student ID number, the course information (CRN, subject, number, and title), and the reason for withdrawal.

4.  **Obtain Instructor's Signature:** The student must obtain the signature of the course instructor. The instructor's signature acknowledges the student's intent to withdraw but does not signify approval or disapproval.

5.  **Submit the Form:** The completed and signed form must be submitted to the Registrar's Office by the withdrawal deadline for the semester. Deadlines are published in the academic calendar on the university website.

### 3.2. Medical or Emergency Withdrawal

In cases of a serious medical condition or other unforeseen emergency that prevents a student from completing a course, a medical or emergency withdrawal may be requested. Such requests are reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

1.  **Contact the Dean of Students Office:** The student or a representative should contact the Dean of Students Office as soon as possible to discuss the situation.

2.  **Provide Documentation:** The student will be required to provide official documentation to support the request. For a medical withdrawal, this includes a letter from a licensed healthcare provider. For other emergencies, appropriate documentation (e.g., police report, obituary) is required.

3.  **Review Process:** The Dean of Students Office will review the request and documentation and, if approved, will notify the Registrar's Office to process the withdrawal.

## 4. Deadlines and Timelines

-   **Withdrawal Deadline:** The deadline to withdraw from a course with a "W" grade is typically at the end of the 10th week of a 15-week semester. Specific dates for each semester are published in the official Academic Calendar.
-   **Late Withdrawals:** Requests for withdrawals after the deadline will only be considered in cases of documented medical or other emergencies and must be initiated through the Dean of Students Office.

## 5. Implications of Withdrawal

### 5.1. Academic Standing

A "W" grade is not calculated into the student's Grade Point Average (GPA). However, a pattern of withdrawals may be a cause for concern and could impact a student's academic standing. Students should consult the university's policy on Satisfactory Academic Progress.

### 5.2. Transcript

The "W" grade will appear on the student's official academic transcript. It indicates that the student was enrolled in the course but withdrew before completing it.

## 6. Financial Aid Impact

Withdrawing from a course may have significant financial aid implications. Students receiving financial aid are required to maintain a certain pace of course completion.

-   **Pace of Completion:** Withdrawing from a course can lower a student's pace of completion, which may affect their eligibility for future financial aid.
-   **Return of Title IV Funds:** If a student withdraws from all courses, the university may be required to return a portion of the federal financial aid funds to the government. This may result in the student owing a balance to the university.

Students are strongly advised to consult with the Financial Aid Office before withdrawing from a course to understand the potential financial consequences.

## 7. Required Forms and Systems

-   **Course Withdrawal Form:** Available on the Registrar's Office website and at their office.
-   **Student Information System (SIS):** Students can view their current enrollment and academic records through the university's SIS portal.
