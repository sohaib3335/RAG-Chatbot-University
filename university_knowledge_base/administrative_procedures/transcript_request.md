### 1. Purpose and Overview

This document outlines the official procedures for current and former students of Westfield State University to request and receive their official academic transcripts. An official transcript is a comprehensive record of a student's academic history, including all coursework, grades, and degrees conferred. This procedure ensures that transcript requests are handled securely, efficiently, and in compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).

Official transcripts are often required for graduate school applications, job applications, professional licensing, and transferring to other institutions. Westfield State University offers several methods for requesting and receiving transcripts to accommodate the diverse needs of our student and alumni community.

### 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all current and former students of Westfield State University, including undergraduate, graduate, and professional studies students. It also applies to all university staff involved in the processing and distribution of official transcripts, primarily the Office of the University Registrar.

### 3. Procedures

#### 3.1. Online Ordering (Preferred Method)

Westfield State University has partnered with Parchment, a secure third-party transcript ordering service, to process all online transcript requests. This is the fastest and most convenient method for ordering transcripts.

3.  **Submit the Request:** Once logged in, follow the on-screen prompts to place your order. You will need to specify the recipient's information (e.g., another university, an employer, or yourself). You can select either an electronic or paper transcript.
4.  **Payment:** Pay the applicable fees using a major credit or debit card. The fee structure is detailed in Section 4 of this document.
5.  **Authorization:** In compliance with FERPA, you must provide electronic authorization for the release of your academic records. This is typically done by signing with your mouse or finger on the screen.
6.  **Track Your Order:** You will receive email notifications regarding the status of your order, including when it is processed and when it has been delivered (for electronic transcripts) or mailed.

### 7. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Can my parents or spouse request my transcript for me?**
A: Due to FERPA regulations, only the student can request their official transcript. The only exception is with a signed, written consent form from the student.

**Q: What is the difference between an official and an unofficial transcript?**
A: An official transcript is printed on security paper, bears the university seal and the Registrar's signature, and is sent directly to the intended recipient in a sealed envelope or via a secure electronic service. An unofficial transcript is a plain paper copy of your academic record for personal use and does not have the security features of an official transcript.

**Q: How can I get an unofficial transcript?**
A: Current students can view and print their unofficial transcript at any time through the university's student information portal.

**Q: I have a hold on my account. Can I still get a transcript?**
A: No, all financial holds must be cleared before an official transcript can be released. Please contact the Bursar's Office to resolve any holds.
