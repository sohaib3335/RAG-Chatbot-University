**Effective Date:** September 1, 2023

## Overview

Westfield State University is dedicated to providing a safe and secure environment for all students, faculty, staff, and visitors. The Department of Campus Safety and Security Services (CSS) is a full-service, 24/7 department committed to protecting the university community. Our team of certified campus police officers and security professionals works diligently to prevent crime, respond to emergencies, and offer a variety of safety-related programs and services. This document outlines the resources available through CSS to help you stay safe on campus. 

## Services and Resources

### Campus Police

The Westfield State University Police Department (WSUPD) is a sworn police agency with full law enforcement authority on all university property. Officers are on duty 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, providing patrol services, investigating crimes, and enforcing all state and local laws, as well as university regulations. Our officers are professionally trained and certified by the state, and they are committed to a community-oriented policing model.  Patrols are conducted on foot, by bicycle, and in marked patrol vehicles to ensure high visibility and rapid response times.

### Emergency Procedures

In the event of a campus-wide emergency, such as a natural disaster or active threat, the university will activate its Emergency Response Plan. Official information and instructions will be disseminated through the **WSU Alerts** system. This multi-platform system sends emergency notifications via text message, email, and voice call to all registered users. Additionally, alerts will be posted on the university’s official social media channels and the university homepage. All students, faculty, and staff are automatically enrolled in this system. It is your responsibility to ensure your contact information is kept up-to-date in the university portal to receive these critical alerts.

### Safety Escorts

For your safety and peace of mind, CSS offers a **SafeWalk** program. A uniformed security officer will escort you to any location on campus, including parking lots, residence halls, and academic buildings. This service is available 24/7 and is free of charge. To request a SafeWalk, simply call the CSS non-emergency line or use the WSU Safe mobile app. We recommend using this service when walking alone at night or if you ever feel unsafe.

### Blue Light Phones

Emergency Blue Light Phones are strategically located throughout campus in high-traffic areas, parking lots, and along major pedestrian routes. These phones provide a direct, one-button connection to the CSS dispatch center. When you press the emergency button, the phone automatically identifies your location, allowing for a rapid police response. The blue light on top of the phone kiosk is illuminated 24/7, making it easy to spot from a distance. Use these phones to report emergencies, request assistance, or report suspicious activity.

### Crime Reporting

We encourage all members of the campus community to report any suspected criminal activity or safety concerns promptly. Vigilance and prompt reporting are crucial for maintaining a safe campus environment. You can report a crime or concern in several ways:

*   **For Emergencies:** Immediately dial 911. An emergency is any situation that requires immediate police, fire, or medical response to preserve life or property.
*   **For Non-Emergencies:** Call the CSS non-emergency line at (555) 123-4567. This number is for situations that do not pose an immediate threat.
*   **In Person:** Visit the CSS office in the Student Services Building, Room 112.
*   **Using a Blue Light Phone:** Press the emergency button on any Blue Light Phone to be connected with a dispatcher.
*   **Anonymous Reporting:** If you wish to report a crime anonymously, you can use the **WSU Safe** mobile app, which allows for confidential two-way communication with CSS.

### Safety Programs

CSS is committed to proactive crime prevention and safety education. We offer a variety of safety programs and training opportunities throughout the academic year, including:

*   **Active Shooter Response Training (Run, Hide, Fight):** These sessions provide guidance on how to respond in the unlikely event of an active shooter situation on campus.
*   **Self-Defense Classes:** In partnership with the Department of Recreational Sports, we offer self-defense classes for students, faculty, and staff.
*   **Alcohol and Drug Awareness:** CSS works with other campus departments to provide educational programs on the risks of substance abuse.
*   **Operation ID:** This program involves marking your valuable property with a unique identification number to deter theft and to aid in recovery if your property is stolen.
